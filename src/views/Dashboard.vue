    <p style="color:#666;">
      This system is a simple vehicle collision detection admin platform built with Vue3, Spring Boot, and MySQL.

It is used to manage users and family groups, and to view sensor data uploaded by vehicles.

The admin can check user information, family members, and visualize collision-related data using line charts for basic analysis.
